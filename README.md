# Josh's dotfiles
_(With credit to  [holmans dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles)._

My dotfiles are very similar to holmans dotfiles referenced above, with some
changes:

* The Rakefile has be altered slightly to accomodate for tld and .config home
  folders (i.e. $HOME/bin and $HOME/.config/beets)
* The directory structure is slightly different, but still effective

The whole thing needs a little bit more cleaning of the cruft I've added to it
before I'll be happy with it.
